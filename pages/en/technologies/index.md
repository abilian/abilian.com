## The colaborative and social Web

We are experts in a large palette of technologies and standards that form the building blocks of the collaborative and social Web: HTML5, Activity Streams, REST APIs, CMIS, OpenSocial, etc.


## Web APIs

All our products are developped *API first*, meaning all their features are available through REST API, ready to be consumed by mobile apps, rich web clients, or integration services.


## Mobiles et tablets

Our products are *mobile ready* thanks to both the use of *responsive design* for their user interface, and the extensive use of REST APIs.
